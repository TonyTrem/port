<!--     <p> grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows are two CSS properties used in grid layouts to define the size, position, and number of columns and rows in the grid.</p>
    <p> grid-template-columns is used to define the columns in the grid. It takes a space-separated list of values that represent the size of each column. For example, if you set grid-template-columns: 100px 50px 200px;, it means that the grid has three columns: the first column is 100 pixels wide, the second column is 50 pixels wide, and the third column is 200 pixels wide.</p>
    <p> grid-template-rows is used to define the rows in the grid. It takes a space-separated list of values that represent the size of each row. For example, if you set grid-template-rows: 50px 100px 75px;, it means that the grid has three rows: the first row is 50 pixels high, the second row is 100 pixels high, and the third row is 75 pixels high.</p>
    <p> Both grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows can also accept other types of values, such as percentages or fractions. They can also use the repeat() function to create a repeated pattern of columns or rows with a certain size.</p>
    <p> Overall, grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows are very useful properties for creating complex grid layouts that can adapt to different screen sizes and content.</p> -->
<!-- 
    <p> grid-template is a shorthand property for defining grid columns, rows, and areas. It is a convenient way to create a grid layout with just one declaration. It takes a space-separated list of values that represent the size of each column and row in the grid. For example, if you set grid-template: 50px 50px / 250px 50px 50px;, it means that the grid has two rows that are 50 pixels high each, and three columns that are 250 pixels, 50 pixels, and 50 pixels wide, respectively.</p>
    <p> grid-template can also accept other types of values, such as percentages or fractions. It can also use the repeat() function to create a repeated pattern of columns or rows with a certain size.</p>
    <p> Overall, grid-template is a very useful property for creating complex grid layouts that can adapt to different screen sizes and content.</p> -->
