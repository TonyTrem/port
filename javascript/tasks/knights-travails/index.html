        //         Your task is to build a function knightMoves that shows the shortest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.

        // You can think of the board as having 2-dimensional coordinates. Your function would therefore look like:

        // knightMoves([0,0],[1,2]) == [[0,0],[1,2]]
        // knightMoves([0,0],[3,3]) == [[0,0],[1,2],[3,3]]
        // knightMoves([3,3],[0,0]) == [[3,3],[1,2],[0,0]]
        // Put together a script that creates a game board and a knight.
        // Treat all possible moves the knight could make as children in a tree. Donâ€™t allow any moves to go off the board.
        // Decide which search algorithm is best to use for this case. Hint: one of them could be a potentially infinite series.
        // Use the chosen search algorithm to find the shortest path between the starting square (or node) and the ending square. Output what that full path looks like, e.g.:
        //   > knightMoves([3,3],[4,3])
        //   => You made it in 3 moves!  Here's your path:
        //     [3,3]
        //     [4,5]
        //     [2,4]
        //     [4,3]

        knightMoves = (start, end) => {
            let moves = [];
            let x = start[0];
            let y = start[1];
            let x2 = end[0];
            let y2 = end[1];
            let x3 = x2 - x;
            let y3 = y2 - y;
            let x4 = x3 / 2;
            let y4 = y3 / 2;
            let x5 = x + x4;
            let y5 = y + y4;
            moves.push([x, y]);
            moves.push([x5, y5]);
            moves.push([x2, y2]);
            return moves;
        }


        console.log(knightMoves([0, 0], [1, 2]));
        console.log(knightMoves([0, 0], [3, 3]));
        console.log(knightMoves([3, 3], [0, 0]));
        console.log(knightMoves([3, 3], [4, 3]));
